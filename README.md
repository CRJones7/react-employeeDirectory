# Employee Directory

## User Story

AS a user
I WANT to be able to view my entire employee directory at once 
SO THAT I have quick access to their information.

## Description
This application is built using react and the Random User.me API. It allows 
an user to search employees by name and updates the table of visible employees 
based on the users input.
